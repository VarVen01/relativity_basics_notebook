## Relativity_Basics_Notebook : A Google Colab Notebook
Explore fundamental concepts in special relativity with interactive Python-based visualizations!

## Overview
Welcome to this Relativity Basics Notebook! This repository contains a Google Colab notebook that demonstrates key ideas in special relativity using Python (numpy and matplotlib) visualizations and coding snippets. This project provides a hands-on approach to Einstein's theories to help users experiment with and learn about fundamental relativistic effects in real time, which also allows them to strengthen their intuition and conceptual understanding of these topics.

## Files Included
'Relativity_Basics_Notebook.ipynb' : The main Google Colab notebook

'table_redshifts.csv' : Supporting dataset for the Doppler Shift section's code snippet

## How to Use
Open and save a COPY of the notebook in Google Colab (no local installation required!).

Read the explanations accompanying each section to deepen understanding.

Run the cells step-by-step to visualize effects of the topics discussed.

Modify parameters to explore how they affect the relevant relativistic effects.

## Features
Interactive Python code to simulate relativistic scenarios

Visualizations for time dilation, length contraction, relativistic momentum, spacetime diagrams, and more!

Numerical simulations of relativistic energy

Real-world applications (ex. GPS corrections)
